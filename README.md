## Hello, Vegan Recipes is pleased to welcome you.

### Here you are on the restserver api of this project 
This app is liaison API pour AngularJS VeganRecipeRestServer_lv

The files in the dist/  folder of VeganRecipeAngularJS_lv are sent to the VeganRecipeRestServer_lv app in the public/ folder. This app is associated with a NoSql database at mongoLab


## For this project 
For this project, I wanted to create a cooking site with MEAN technology (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS and Node.js.)
This the Ionic'version for the mobile site.
  
I took as the basis the site [Recipesoriginales.fr](http://www.recettesoriginales.fr/).
I brought some novelties like locating a restaurant's vegan or a store's vegan (for more places not yet sorryâ€¦). 
A page for all the publication on instagram are visible.
As a user (if you log in) you will be able to publish your recipes and note those of the other members.
  
I hope you enjoy this site. I wish you a good journey ;-)
